this is just 2^level binary splitting if the maximum amount of splitters exist on a row

Removing one splitter from a full splitter can be viewed as a sort of inverted Euler's pyramid, where the bottom is built first and then summed toward the top

 3 3
1 2 1

Knocking out one splitter reduces the total by this amount

# Knockout multiple
The pattern doesn't continue as this trivial example shows

So this approach probably won't help

# Difference from first part
In the first part we counted splits but ignored duplicates, but to count timelines maybe we can just count splits but include the duplicates?
